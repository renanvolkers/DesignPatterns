# Builder
is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

Imagine that you're building a computer system from scratch. There are many components to consider, such as the processor, motherboard, memory, storage, and graphics card. Each component has its own set of attributes and specifications, and you need to carefully select the right ones to create a computer that performs well and meets your needs.

One approach to building a computer system is to use the Builder design pattern. The Builder pattern separates the construction of an object from its representation, allowing you to create complex objects step by step. In the context of computer hardware and software, the Builder pattern can be used to create a custom computer system with specific components and configurations.
