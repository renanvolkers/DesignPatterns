# Factory Method
Is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

# Example 1 
For example, in a Language Grammar, you may want to use the Factory Method pattern to create different types of Laguage. The factory would have a method for creating a Grammar, and depending on the type of Grammar you want to create, it will return an object of the appropriate class.
